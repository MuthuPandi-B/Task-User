This project is a User Authentication API built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication. The main purpose is to provide a set of RESTful API endpoints that allow users to register, log in, and retrieve user information securely. It also includes middleware for token verification, making protected routes accessible only to authenticated users. The code is organized for clarity, maintainability, and scalability.
